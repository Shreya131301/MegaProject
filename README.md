SURAKSHA APP AND WEBSITE

This project is mainly for situations where one may need immediate help. Our Suraksha app makes sure that at a time, all our trusted people are contacted so that atleast someone will be there
to help us. This app is mainly for emergency situations where one may seek immediate help but the person we are tying to contact may not be available so it contacts all the trusted persons at a time 
and the website is for encouraging people to act and not be afraid, share their stories and inspire others and to help others understand on how to tackle with diffiult situations.
